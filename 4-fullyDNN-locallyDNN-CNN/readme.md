We compare the following neural networks on handwritten digit recogintion task:
- Fully connectted network
- locally connected network without weights shared
- Convolutional network

Several regularization techniques and hyperparameters are compared on all three networks:
- weight initialization
- Learning rate
- Batach normalization
- Monmentum
- Dropout
- Ensemble Learning
