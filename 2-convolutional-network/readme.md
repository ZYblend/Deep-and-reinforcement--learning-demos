# Convolutional Network

- conv_network: A convolutional network for classifying hand-writing numbers
- Prog3: Visulize filter, feature maps, understand why shifting on image will result in wrong classification
- prog4: use 8X8 patch to occulde different part of image, examinate which part is the most important to identify
